# Todo list

1. Check angle error metric
1. Problem with metrics. Inconsistent metrics between online and offline pose estimation versions.
2. Check if I can compile AMBF with anaconda built-in ros. 
3. Set automatic connection


# Notes

The `robotstackenv` environment has a problem with matplotlib and PyKDL. If matplotlib is imported first that will create problems. The problem most likely is being caused by having a mixtures of different python interpreters in my computer.
